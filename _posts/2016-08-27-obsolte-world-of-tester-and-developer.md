title: The Obsolete World of Tester And Developer
---

It has been coming for a while; this breakdown, this bankruptcy of a worldview. I didn't see it. I was blind to it.

I always called myself a 'Tester' and I used a twitter name `@rubytester` but now I am dismantling this world.

The blindness is obvious now. There is a world out there, a world of separation of Testers and Developers. This world of separate social groups. The world of separate social gatherings, meet-ups, conferences. The world of separate organizations in companies. The world of separate conversations.

It finally hit me. Conway's Law - I knew about Conway's Law for years; I often looked at situations where social interfaces between groups produced software interfaces in systems. I simply pointed to this phenomenon and said "Yep, this is Conway's Law in play." yet I didn't see it in my worldview. Blindspots, my blindspots.

It finally hit me about 2 weeks ago. This linguistic construct, the moniker, the role, the identity that persists the separateness by calling myself a 'Tester', a 'Tester' not as a name for a set of activities and value creation but a 'Tester' as an Identity, a Role, a Worldview, confining, carving off, boundary setting, separating from the Other. Ouch.

The Other? The Developer, if I am a 'Tester' then what is Developer in this world? For the separateness of Software Tester as an independent, distinct identity with its power and purpose there has to be another world opposing, a necessary 'other' identify that is not a 'Tester'. That other world is a 'Developer'. This 'developer', frequently a caricature of a real programmer, a real person who is not on my team, with me but across the wall. Us versus Them.

Can that be dismantled? Would something be possible that is now not possible? This is a Bilbo Baggings moment, something new possible. I'm dismantling my online 'Tester' persona, I deleted my twitter moniker '@rubytester', I removed accounts associated with 'Tester'.

There is nothing wrong with the word 'Tester', it is an Identity that persists, blinding me, keeping me separate from 'Other'. That world is now obsolete. It's over.

There is grief now, some anger, depression, and acceptance.
