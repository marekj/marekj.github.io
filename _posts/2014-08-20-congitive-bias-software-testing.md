# What is Cognitive Bias

From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias)" - "pattern of deviation in judgment" which may cause "Illogical interpretation".

Is it a bad thing? The bias itself is not a bad thing nor a bood thing (that would be another bias in thinking that you have to disect each phenomenon into good or bad category).

However it may be very beneficial to know what cognitive bias is running your logical reasoning (either at the time of reasoning by observing your reasoning or after having reasoned by observing the outcome of your reasoning). If you can recognize the bias you can consider the cost and payoff of having that bias run your thinking. If proceeding with the bias is benefitial in a particular context you can let the bias inform you and act on it (it can be a form of heuristics) or discard the bias and select another bias or more rational thinking.

The danger is in being blind to what cognitive bias is currently coloring your world view. When not recognized the Bias itself becomes a 'thinking driver' where the world view and conclusions of situations in a given context are limited by the bias.

Let's consider the cognitive bias as a map of thinking. Looking at the map, like you look at any physical map, allows you to see where you came from, what options you have, which way to go. One is free to substitute the map for any other map. A bit of a cliche here is to say [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation]("the map is not the territory"). The saying in itself is empty and meaningless when you are presented with a context of having no clue as to the territory, you need some map as a heuristic to navigate. The saying works when the heuristic of 'map' introduces Cognitive Bias and your thinking produces errors of judgement like: "I see there is a lake on the map here. let's move the lake over that mountain".

What does that have to do with Software Testing?

One could start with Invisible Gorilla and other experiments that reveal the cognitive biases. Sofware Development is a Human Endeavor, cognitive bias is a given in this context. One does not simply remove the bias but be aware of it and use it to gain or lose paying customers. It's a competitive advantage to test sofware while being aware you may be losing paying customers because you don't attend to their cognitive bias that colors their judgement of your application flow.
